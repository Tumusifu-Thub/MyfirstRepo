Hello, I have learned so many things that i didn't know in this course, first I have learned how to create a GitHub account, how to download git, how to create a repository in GitHub and us well how to work with different branches and how to merge them after, that's not all I have also learned how clone my remote repo to my local machine which I found so intriguing to be able to work on project locally from your remote repo which in GitHub. and then after there is, - git status, git add, git commit, and git pull for version control.
